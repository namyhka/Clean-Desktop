# Clean-Desktop

## Why?

I have a lot of files in my desktop due to my habit of always saving stuff in the desktop. Also, my MBP always saves screenshots on my desktop so there are a lot of PNG files as well which further clutters the screen.

This code fixes that.

## Future updates

I'm planning to implement the ff. fixed when I get the time to do so -

1. More paths
2. If extension type folder does not yet exist, create one
3. Misc items go to misc folder
4. Combine 2 for loops for one file type (xls and xlsx) into just one for loop
